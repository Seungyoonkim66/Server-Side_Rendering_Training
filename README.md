Also, the initial rendering by server makes waiting time of the user less. This results to nice UX :) 
## disadvantage of server-side rendering 
> Some tasks that was originally reponsible for client's browser is performed by the server. This means that we user server resources to render in server-side. 
Also, It can make code more complex :(
